## ✅ Osa 4 – Backend: Express, MongoDB, and User Authentication

This part focuses on backend development using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It teaches how to:

- Set up a REST API  
- Connect to a MongoDB database  
- Implement CRUD operations for blogs  
- Add user authentication with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**  
- Test the backend using **Jest** and **Supertest**

---

### ✔️ I completed all tasks except:

- ❌ **Task 4.5**: Implemented blog list with token but didn't test yet  
- ❌ **Task 4.6**: Login functionality test  
- ❌ **Task 4.7**: Add user tests for invalid inputs
